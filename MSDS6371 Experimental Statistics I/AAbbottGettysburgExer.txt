1. mean = 4.301
2. the range appears to be from 1 to 11
3. sd = .963
4. the distribution is very slightly right tailed, with a median of 4.008. the density is mostly between 2 and 7.
5.	a. mean = 4.252
	sd = 0.636
	b. mean = 4.283
	sd = 0.473
	c. mean = 4.293
	sd = 0.268
6.	
	a. The population distribution is slightly right tailed, the distribution of the means of 500 samples of size 10 is symmetric about its mean.  
	b. The population distribution is slightly right tailed, the distribution of the means of 500 samples of size 20 is slightly tilted the other way but near symmetric. 
	c. The population distribution is slightly right tailed, the distribution of the means of 500 samples of size 50 is more symmetric about its mean.
